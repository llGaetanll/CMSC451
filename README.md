# Advanced Algorithms

These are my notes for CMSC451 - Advanced Algorithms, taken at the University of
Maryland in the Spring of 2023 with Andrew Childs.

These notes are not meant to be comprehensive (although they largely may be) and
will likely not be updated (at least not significantly.) Despite this, I still
think that they may come in handy to anybody wishing or considering to take the class.
